This will give you a clear set of tools (and an insurance policy) to deal with conflict as and when it may occur. You should sleep well at night… you have earned it.\r\n\r\nHowever, he will also go much deeper and dig into other challenging moments...whether there is conflict or not...such as mismatched expectations, uncertainty, burnout, uncertainty, company/community relations, and much more.\r\n\r\nBuckle yourself into a practical session with best practice and experience you can apply today, all underlined with Bacon's loose, entertaining, and engaging delivery.",

Especially frustrating is that the compiler usually has enough context to have been able to stop the overflow but C APIs are so terrible that it doesn't happen.\r\n\r\nWe'll take a quick look back through at least the last 3 years of heap buffer overflow CVEs in the kernel. This will lead to the discovery that all 11 memcpy overflows from this timespan (which includes the heap buffer overflow flaw used by the BleedingTooth exploit), could have been detected and mitigated by the compiler. However, limitations in C language usage, APIs, kernel coding conventions, and compiler bugs made this a difficult problem to tackle.\r\n\r\nWe will explore the path to solutions being developed in the Linux kernel for dealing with array index overflows, string manipulation overflows, and especially memcpy overflows. We will cover the history of C flexible arrays, the unexpected places where the \"-Warray-bounds\" and \"-fsanitize=bounds\" compiler options don't work, the limits of \"__builtin_object_size\" (the work-horse of FORTIFY_SOURCE), and how memcpy is being effectively replaced to stop overflows from ever happening again.",

    "abstract": "Stereoscopic imagery (photography and videography) is a fascinating way to create 3-dimensional images of landscapes, unmoving and moving objects, and of course, people.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I cover the basics of stereoscopic imagery and projection, discover how stereoscopic vision works, and how we can trick our brains into perceiving depth from two flat images.\r\n\r\nI start with the principles of three-dimensional vision in humans: how our eyes use the combination of accommodation and vergence to signal two slightly different images of our surroundings to our brain, and how our brain then processes these images to give us the perception of depth. Then, I discuss the techniques available to play tricks on our brains in which two slightly (but cleverly) distinct two-dimensional images are presented to our eyes in such a way that our mind conjures up depth where there objectively is none.\r\n\r\nThese techniques come in various forms, from very high tech (such as virtual reality goggles) to very low tech (like mechanical stereoscopic viewers), but some can deal without any projection technology at all: this is called freeviewing, and for most people it is a remarkably simple and low-cost way to enjoy stunning three-dimensional imagery. I cover the parallel-view and crossview freeviewing techniques.\r\n\r\nI then dive into the simple but highly effective steps of making stereoscopic images, using run-of-the-mill cameras (even cell phones), and some straightforward image processing in the GIMP.\r\n\r\nFinally, I talk about some neat little tricks to make stereoscopic videos, with minimal cost and investment.

At the most basic level, we too often subconsciously assume that the person who is good at maths and science will be a poor communicator, the person who has done an Arts degree will struggle with science and maths.\r\n\r\nOur world is enriched when we incorporate the ideas and skills from different professional communities. We will all benefit the more that STEM becomes STEAM by welcoming people with Arts backgrounds into our technical and business teams. Drawing on her professional journey which started in chartered accounting, then public relations, professional historical research and is now morphing into technical documentation, Yvonne will demonstrate how professionals outside the STEM disciplines are experimenting with technology and developing skills that can assist IT teams. \r\n\r\nWhile professional communities should be looking outward and welcoming the ideas and skills of people in other professional communities, it is also important to make the effort to enter other professional worlds. By speaking at this conference Yvonne is making that effort and is grateful to the Linux community for this opportunity. \r\n\r\nProfessional communities also span geographic boundaries. In her talk Yvonne will discuss her experience learning from the global digital humanities field through online and face-to-face opportunities. Online interactions have not been disrupted by the pandemic, but face-to-face opportunities have been severely curtailed. Yvonne will discuss the implications of this for people who are seeking to cement their place in a community.\r\n\r\nIt is not enough to say that we welcome others, we also need to demonstrate that we are a welcoming community by every person exhibiting the kind of personal qualities that make people new to the community feel welcome. It is also important that the newcomers in a professional community show a willingness to learn and listen. Drawing on her personal experience, Yvonne will give both good and bad examples. \r\n\r\nDuring this presentation Yvonne will talk about her work with digitised material provided by Australia’s GLAM sector, the Trove portal and Trove API provided by the National Library of Australia, demonstrating how these important public resources have contributed greatly to her professional development.",

Another common problem is wanting to have an encrypted backup system, but you're bad at remembering good passphrases. Depending on your particular situation, these two scenarios can also overlap and you want to give your friends and family the ability to access backups or other private data in the case you are incapacitated or worse.\r\n\r\nPaperback attempts to solve both of these problems through a fairly low-tech paper-based backup solution based on Shamir Secret Sharing (SSS). While there are a few other threshold backup systems, paperback is the first one  I am aware of which is trying to make itself usable by a less technically-capable people (after all, the main user will be your heirs who are not necessarily technically capable) and not depend on any digital services except during the creation and recovery of backups. It also supports some neat features (such as allowing new shards to be minted after the fact) which are straight-forward applications of SSS but to my knowledge are not found in many other SSS-based projects.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will go through the design and philosophy behind paperback, some interesting applications, the current state of the project and where you may be able to help.

Properties of this network can then be directly measured using various statistical techniques quantifying the relative number of connections between different papers or authors.\r\n\r\nTraditionally a labour intensive process, CNA techniques are rapidly becoming more accessible through global citation databases and freely available software.

    "abstract": "If you've learned a new programming language in the past 20 years, there's a good chance it features automatic memory management. One of the most popular ways of managing memory is through a garbage collector (GC), which frees memory by regularly deallocating unreferenced data. Optimising programming languages' GC algorithms and implementations can be key to improving the performance of large scale, low-latency and high-throughput systems. However, state-of-the-art GC algorithms can be difficult to implement, which often results in new language designers trading performance for simplicity. Additionally, garbage collectors are often tightly integrated into the language runtime, which makes it difficult for existing languages to optimise their GC or switch to new algorithms altogether.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we introduce the Memory Management Toolkit (MMTk), an Open Source runtime-agnostic garbage collection framework being developed by researchers at ANU. MMTk provides developers with a large library of high-performance GC algorithms (ranging from tried-and-tested to cutting-edge), exposed behind a unified bidirectional API. The project aims to simplify GC implementation for both researchers and the developers of new & existing programming languages alike. We discuss the lessons learned from integrating MMTk into MRI, the main interpreter for the Ruby programming language.",

    "abstract": "The seL4 microkernel is the world's first operating system (OS) kernel with a machine-checked proof of implementation correctness (originally completed in 2009 for 32-bit Arm processors). This was followed by more wold-firsts: proofs of security enforcement, proof of correctness of the executable binary, sound worst-case execution-time analysis.\r\nseL4 had been developed and verified at NICTA, a public-sector research organisation, and open-sourced in 2014. With NICTA being absorbed into CSIRO in 2015, the seL4 developers, known as the Trustworthy Systems (TS) team, became part of CSIRO, and research, development and community support continued there, mostly through funding from the US government (DARPA) and industry. However, uptake remained limited outside the defence sector. In April 2020 we created the seL4 Foundation (as a project of the Linux Foundation) as a way to encourage broader community engagement as well as removing dependency on a single organisation.\r\nThe importance of the latter aspect became obvious when in May 2021 CSIRO announced that it was abandoning the Trustworthy Systems group and its research agenda of developing truly secure computer systems. This was a near-death experience for seL4: many of our highly-skilled staff and students had job offers within days. The TS team would have disintegrated within weeks, leaving seL4 orphaned, had not UNSW stepped up and offered to fund the team to the end of the year, giving us much needed breathing space.\r\nThis was followed by an amazing rallying of the community.  While before we had trouble scaling Foundation membership beyond the half-dozen initial members, companies we never heard of (but who were already building seL4 into their products) joined, increasing the Foundation's membership revenue ten-fold over a period of about 2 months. Many former staff increased their engagement (with backing from their employers), and community contributions increased massively. At the same time the TS continued to hit new firsts, especially on verification and security proofs for seL4 on 64-bit RISC-V. The technology and its ecosystem are very much alive and growing.\r\nWhich leaves a number of questions to explore, specifically: (1) why did we not achieve more community engagement before the cataclysmic events of May'20, and (2) why did things suddenly take off after?\r\nI can only attempt to provide (at best partial) answers, and will welcome feedback from other community leaders. However it is clear that (1) had to do with the steep learning curve of seL4, but also organisational barriers. Specifically, seL4 development was not really open until we set up the Foundation, and even then it took a long time to move everything out from CSIRO, a process that was still on-going when the divorce was announced. Yet it became clear that there was far more seL4 adaptation in industry than we were aware of. (2) was clearly enabled by this existing activity: people realised that the whole of seL4 was under threat, and they had to contribute back if they wanted it to live on. Which leaves us with the question of what could we have done differently to get them engaged earlier, and how can we engage even more of the adopters? There are clearly many more out there.",

The reality in Australia is that we have a lot of good will, but agtech remains underfunded, and many applications and platforms are struggling to simultaneously survive and build scale, integration, and interoperability.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2019 Lyndsey took on the CTO role of Australian agtech startup Platfarm. The function of the application had been proven, but the work of attracting funding, reengineering for scale, and releasing the application in stores was still ahead. \r\n\r\nWhile leading a small team through this journey, we also took the time to spearhead the development of open data standards for the viticulture industry through the “Collabriculture” project. This project brought together grape growers, industry stakeholders, startups, and developer and mapping experts for a series of workshops leading to the creation of the viticulture data standards. \r\n\r\nThese standards, published openly on github help developers with the naming conventions and considerations of the data model that makes up a vineyard when they go to build, and of course this should make future data sharing easier.\r\n\r\nOpen source mapping standards have been used internally and in the community work we have led. Using Mapbox and Open Street Maps means that data elements such as vine rows, block boundaries, and satellite imagery have been able to be more easily shared. \r\n\r\nThe use of open source software and approaches makes it easier to talk about interoperability and to nudge others into thinking about how the data they input can be shared, exported, and used in other applications. \r\n\r\nData standards in the agtech industry are also important and evolving. Farms as a business have a right and expectation that they will have control over the data from their business, and at the same time there is data that if shared helps regions and growing practices. So we will look at this a bit as well. \r\n\r\nAnd last but not least we will talk about farmers and growers and those working on farms to give an insight into considerations to help developers build tools that will make a difference.",

When we design courses at university, what can we do to produce students who are assets for jobs requiring both tech and GLAMR knowledge?\r\n\r\nWhat do conference participants want graduates of library, records and archives university courses to know?  What is missing - or wonderful - in the disciplinary skills and understanding of graduates you are interviewing or hiring? What do you wish you had learned in your information management course, or that your colleagues had learned? Are graduates of Information Management degrees the best people for GLAMR jobs, or are there other formal qualifications that are more important?\r\n\r\nThree pieces of background to target the conversation. \r\n1. Every industry discussion makes it clear that excellent human beings - regardless of their qualifications - are the best to employ and work with. Often the most-sought qualities are those generally encouraged in all university courses, rather than disciplinary skills. For example ability to take initiative, social intelligence, consideration of others, organisational skills, continous learners, flexibility, great communication and time management. Let's presume we agree on this, and focus on those skills that people would probably not also learn in other degrees.\r\n2. Accredited degrees use as guidance ALIA's Foundation knowledge for entry-level library and information professionals: https://read.alia.org.au/foundation-knowledge-entry-level-library-and-information-professionals . Are there bits missing here?\r\n3. A 10 week course for people who may have no disciplinary background, creating graduates who will work in a very wide range of organisations, tends to mean material covered is broad and foundational, rather than developing depth or proficiency in a narrow range of skills.

    "abstract": "eBPF is the in-kernel virtual machine which lets us use the kernel and leverage a very safe & efficient programming model where we can extract telemetry data from arbitrary* points in the kernel as well as supplement certain throughput critical parts in a programmable way. This model is much safer than writing a custom kernel-module which has high maintenance & can cause kernel-panics/crashes, eBPF does not suffer from these issues as, it has an in-kernel verifier which allows a very restricted set of functionalities. Although, eBPF was earlier targeted at only the network data path, it now has evolved into a framework which can be used in almost everywhere in the kernel. Novel usages include writing TCP congestion control algorithms entirely in user-space and load them to the kernel without having to go through a full kernel release cycle. Apart from the network stack, there are various ad-hoc telemetry data that we can extract from the kernel which can aid in tackling performance problems without modifying the kernel. The advantage of eBPF is its dynamic nature, where we only have the overhead whenever we are running a specific ad-hoc eBPF telemetry program.\r\nThis talk is an introduction to the eBPF subsystem from a perspective of a non-kernel programmer. The talk will explore ideas similar to eBPF like the integration of lua with nginix, web-asm etc. The talk will touch on the end-to-end life cycle of an eBPF program, how we write a program in the user-space, then compile it to the eBPF VM bytecode and how we load the program in the kernel. Once the program is loaded, it still cannot run, unless we attach it to any hook/event in the kernel. These events could be a tracepoint/kprobe or a perf-event. This talk also will touch upon the various types of eBPF programs that are possible e.g xdp, monitoring. For completion an introduction to eBPF maps (storage) which allow us to make state-full decisions for the otherwise stateless eBPF programs.",

Also the hardware provides extensions, which are hard to employ from C and C++ and we need Assembly to get the fastest code.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we'll explore which code GCC and Clang compilers generate for several C and C++ constructions and how to make the code more efficient.

Especially if a customer is having an issue, sometimes all you can do it come up with a hypothesis from the logs and then test in staging or dev environments. But what if you could start tagging a request through the cluster. Better, what if that trace was integrated into the software itself so we can breakdown not only the inter node requests but delve into whats happening on the node itself?\r\n\r\nWell that's exactly what I've been playing with. What started out as middleware bench-marking, and sharing initial results with our SREs has snowballed into request tracing... and to be honest, it's pretty fun. Now we can see:\r\n  - where a request spend it's time.\r\n  - Start getting a visual understanding of what different requests look like in the cluster\r\n  - Use the information to better tune the configuration and topology of the cluster\r\n  - Find areas where we need to put more developer time to optimise different code paths.",

    "title": "A mechanism to isolate CPU topology information in the Linux kernel -- CPU Namespace",
    "abstract": "The CPU namespace aims to extend the current pool of namespaces in the kernel to isolate the system topology view from applications. The CPU namespace virtualizes the CPU information by maintaining an internal translation from the namespace CPU to the logical CPU in the kernel. The CPU namespace will also enable the existing interfaces interfaces like sys/proc, cgroupfs and sched_set(/get)affinity syscalls to be context aware and divulge information of the topology based on the CPU namespace context that requests information from it.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this talk is to propose a mechanism to isolate CPU topology information from applications that are running in a containerized environment.\r\n\r\nThe potential utilities of having the proposed CPU isolation are as follows:\r\n1. An interface for coherent information:\r\n        a. Today, most applications that run on containers enforce their CPU limits requirements with the help of the cgroup interface. Cgroups is a control interface rather than an information interface; hence applications do not have a coherent view of the systems and the restrictions they incur.\r\n        b. The problem extends beyond to coherency of information. Cloud runtime environments can requests for CPU runtime in millicores, which translate to using CFS period and quota to limit CPU runtime in cgroups. However, generally, applications operate in terms of threads with little to no cognizance of the millicore limit or its connotation.\r\nThis can lead to unexpected running behaviors as well as have high impact on performance. Hence, having a coherent interface for divulge information based on constraints set by different subsystems is important. \r\n2. Potential security and fair use implications on multi-tenant systems:\r\n        a. A case where an actor can be in cognizance of the CPU node topology can schedule workloads and select CPUs such that the bus is flooded causing a Denial Of Service attack.\r\n        b. A case wherein identifying the CPU system topology can help identify cores that are close to buses and peripherals such as GPUs to get an undue latency advantage from the rest of the workloads.\r\n\r\nCurrently, all of these problems mentioned above can be mitigated with the use of light weight VMs - Kata Containers. However with the use of a CPU namespace, the isolation advantages that are provided by a Kata Container can be achieved without the heaviness of a virtual machine.\r\n\r\nA survey RFD had been posted here highlighting the problem, its impact and the current solutions that exist in the userspace as well as kernel: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/fe947175-62f5-c3fa-158c-7be2dd886c0e@linux.ibm.com/T/",

    "abstract": "Our day-to-day lives are shaped by public infrastructure.  From roads and footpaths to power lines and fibre-optic cables, we rely on basic foundations to access both utilities and communal spaces.  Similarly, much of the Internet is built on top of open-source frameworks that make it easy to develop complex websites and applications.\r\n\r\nNot all of our public infrastructure is easy for people with disabilities to access.  However, the Internet is far less accessible than physical public spaces.  Various sources have come up with different numbers for 'the percentage of public websites that disabled people can't use'; most are over 50 percent, and depending on the specific disability referenced, some are as high as 98 percent.\r\n\r\nWhat are the barriers that have resulted in that figure being so high?  There are quite a few of them, but one important reason is that so much of the modern internet is built on frameworks, plugins, and extensions.  In the same way that complex signage in cities stops people with cognitive disabilities from travelling independently, and crumbling sidewalks limit wheelchair users to their homes, inaccessible frameworks create a lot of difficulty for folks with disabilities.  Anyone creating a website using them has to do a lot of remediation work if they want the final product to be accessible, and due to time and budget constraints, that work often doesn't happen.\r\n\r\nOf course, provided that they're open-source, anyone can contribute to the common frameworks that power our software.  This gives us an opportunity to make improvements that others can leverage, rather than just remediating issues in your own work.  However, this requires more than just web development skills.  If you want to contribute to accessibility upstream, there are a few things that you'll need to know.\r\n\r\nThis talk will cover the differences between remediating accessibility issues in your own code, and doing so in open-source projects.  We'll learn how to identify the types of issue that we should attempt to fix upstream, and answer some common questions from open-source maintainers about why accessibility improvements are important.

Open source makes this feasible for cryptography, with open source cryptographic libraries handling a huge proportion of information on the internet in flight and at rest. \r\n\r\nDevelopers place a lot of trust in the authors of these libraries to get the cryptography engineering right. \r\n\r\nBut when basic usability issues result in developers using the libraries incorrectly, that trust and painstaking cryptography engineering can be for naught. Worse still, developers often believe they have used the libraries to build something that is secure. But that belief is often mistaken — their use of these libraries is actually insecure.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, attendees will learn: \r\n\r\n1.

    "title": "gprofng: The Next Generation GNU Profiling Tool",
    "abstract": "In this talk we present an overview of gprofng, a next generation profiling tool for Linux.\r\n\r\nThis profiler has its roots in the Performance Analyzer from the Oracle Developer Studio product. Gprofng is a standalone tool however and specifically targets Linux. It includes several tools to collect and view the performance data. Various processors from Intel, AMD, and Arm are supported.\r\n\r\nThe focus is on applications written in C, C++, Java, and Scala. For C/C++ we assume gcc has been used to build the code. In the case of Java and Scala, OpenJDK and compatible implementations are supported.\r\n\r\nAmong other things, another difference with the widely known gprof tool is that gprofng offers full support for shared libraries and multithreading using Posix Threads, OpenMP, or Java Threads.\r\n\r\nUnlike gprof, gprofng can also be used in case the source code of the target executable is not available. Gprofng also works with unmodified executables. There is no need to recompile, or instrument the code. By profiling the production executable it is ensured that the profile reflects the actual run time behaviour and conditions of a production run.\r\n\r\nAfter the data has been collected, the performance information can be viewed at the function, source, and disassembly level. Individual thread views are supported as well. Through command line options, the user specifies the information to be displayed. In addition to this, a simple, but yet powerful scripting feature can be used to produce a variety of performance reports in an automated way. This may also be combined with filters to zoom in on specific aspects of the profile. For example, it is very easy to zoom in on one or more threads, but also to compare the behaviour across threads.\r\n\r\nOne of the very powerful features of gprofng is the ability to compare two or more profiles. This allows for an easy way to spot regressions, or find scalability bottlenecks for example.\r\n\r\nIn the talk, we start with a description of the architecture of the gprofng tools suite. This is followed by an overview of the various tools that are available, plus the main features. A comparison with gprof will be made, but the bulk of the talk consists of examples to show the functionality and features. We conclude with the plans for future developments. This includes a GUI to graphically navigate through the data.",

Many of us rely on smart watches to remind us to take a break from our desks and to count the number of steps we take in a day.

You'll learn how the biometrics craze of the nineteenth century led to the development of phrenology, a pseudoscience that used the shape of the skull to justify everything from matchmaking to murder. You'll follow the echoes of this thinking through to the more recent past, where the ability to measure a human body in detail initially left the menstrual cycle out entirely and then swung hard the other way, allowing employers to buy access to live feeds of their employees' fertility planning. And you'll hear about what's happening now: of facial recognition systems that cover cities, of how employers have monitored locked-down employees as they work from home, and of the ethical frameworks that activists argue for compared to the ones companies adopt.\r\n\r\nThere's a lot that our bodies can tell us - but we need to learn how to draw out the right stories.",

The particular property of multi-homed systems is to be connected to multiple Internet Service Providers (ISP) simultaneously. Its initial purpose is of course to still provide connectivity in case of ISP/network failures. But does it really work that well, also with current protocols and applications? And redundancy does not come for free. A user connected to multiple ISPs will also receive multiple Internet bills each month. So, is there a possibility to make further use of multi-homing in the usual case where nothing goes wrong? Obviously, there are a lot of interesting research questions, which need to be examined in realistic Internet setups! Therefore, we are building up the NorNet open Internet testbed platform as a Linux- and Open-Source-software-based infrastructure, which currently spreads over multiple sites in different countries.\r\n\r\nNorNet makes extensive use of advanced Linux features like Kernel-based Virtualisation (KVM), Linux Containers (LXC), BTRFS file system features, IP routing rules, Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP), Multi-Path TCP (MPTCP), and many more. The goal of this talk is therefore to present an overview of the testbed, its underlying Linux features, and how they are combined to provide the multi-homing features to the various testbed users. This particularly includes an overview of how to make use of multi-path transport with MPTCP – based on the Linux MPTCP implementation – in multi-homed environments.

    "abstract": "In 2017, three Australian groups that participated in the yearly National Novel Writing Month event were looking for someone to build a chatbot to help them migrate onto Discord from IRC. Without knowing what I was getting myself into, I volunteered to do it. And thus, Winnie the Writing Bot was born.\r\n\r\nIn 2018, I posted setup instructions for the chatbot on the official forums for the event. All of a sudden, Winnie had a user base that was rapidly outscaling the quality of my terrible Javascript. Between a full-time job and the demands of the community, I realised that I was in over my head. In 2019, as National Novel Writing Month rolled out a website redesign that was widely criticised by the community, I started looking for someone to take over the project.\r\n\r\nAnd then, 2020 happened. Suddenly, all in-person events were cancelled, and National Novel Writing Month communities around the world were scrambling to move their entire operations online. And I found myself as the sole maintainer of an open-source bodge job that was being used by local organisers who had to fill quite a lot of gaps at very short notice. But more than that, I had a vibrant community of people who were ready and willing to improve the software that they used. My role wasn't to build the whole thing from the ground up anymore; it was to get myself out of the do-it-all mindset and and use my skills to help us all make Winnie better.\r\n\r\nOver the course of 2021, we rebuilt Winnie with a focus on maintainable code.  More importantly, we've integrated feedback as we've gone, and added the building blocks for significant new features that the community wants.  Having people in defined roles, including the project manager who found a bug that took down the whole system and volunteered his expertise by way of apology, has allowed us to go beyond what a single maintainer can get done.  All the way through the project, I've been learning about systems and processes that I should have set up early-on, from codes of conduct to maintainable databases to community spaces.  As it's grown from a one-person bodge job to an open-source project, I've been able to see the benefits of these structures in real time.\r\n\r\nThis is a story of timezones, emoji, localisation, and how to wrangle velociraptors into a database.

It's a story which connects people from around the world who might not have otherwise met.  The trajectory of my career has been influenced by the various hats that I've worn during the process, but it would never have happened without the people who did the real hard work of building their communities.  Everyone who stepped in to help with localisation, development, testing, and even documentation helped this little open-source chatbot to provide both individual and collective structures in a time of great uncertainty.  In a period where our social structures have been involuntarily remade on a global scale, I hope that my experience can provide a roadmap for those who want to harness free and open-source software to fill gaps in the non-technical world, and make outrageous ideas happen.  Even if it is by accident.",

    "title": "Confessions of a Crypto Miner",
    "abstract": "This presentation covers the personal journey of an individual in mining and contributing to the Bitcoin open-source community.\r\n\r\nIt was a sunny morning in 2011 when I first became aware of the existence of Bitcoin. I was strolling down Salamanca in Hobart, doom scrolling twitter, one of the folks in the OSGi community I was part of back then posted something along the lines of \"Don't believe the naysayers, Bitcoin will be back to $1\".\r\n\r\nI wanted to figure out what to this Bitcoin thing was and got nerd sniped straight into the abyss. I installed a CPU miner, it was very slow, so I got myself a few GPU's (may be 20). Then some FPGA's and brushed off my university VHDL. I joined a mining pool, eligius, both from the mining client, bfgminer, and in person on Freenode. Something in the name and my Catholic boys school upbringing resonated. I went onto meet Luke-jr who was checking in Bible verses on the blockchain and persisting it everywhere. I also met a whole cabal of people writing software, firmware, gateware and designing PCB's and ASIC's to make all this work. I was there for the ASIC boom and the first batch of antminers I ordered were delivered to the right street name and number, but the wrong postcode. DHL probably owes me a house now for the lost revenue.\r\n\r\nI stopped mining when the energy costs became too high. My interests pivoted to energy monitoring. When all is said and done Bitcoin is perhaps the most successful open source project other than Linux itself. I made good friends and acquaintances along the way, learnt more than I cared about regarding cryptography, financial systems, hardware manufacturing and supply chains. Hope others can approach this with the same curiosity, rather than greed and build their knowledge.",

Most likely, they take the form of cyber- or cyber-physical systems, where the constituent components - boxen, VAXen, Docksen, ESPen, are quite literally connected - possibly over some form of internet protocol. These systems may be orchestrated or organic - but always serve a purpose. They can co-operate, collide and compete with each other (and then there were 15 standards). They can operate loosely or be tightly controlled. They exist for a brief period of time (less brief if they contain COBOL), until they are disassembled, disaggregated and decommed back to electrons and e-waste.\r\n\r\nBut what about the people in those systems? How are they connected? Why are they part of the system? Or not? What roles do they serve? What are their inputs and outputs? Plot twist! Communities are systems too! The concepts we use for thinking about computer and cyber systems can also be used to uncover insights about communities, and how we go about creating, curating and concluding them.",
