Allan has been using linux since the late 90s, where he remembers picking up a RedHat disc on a magazine. He has long been a tinkerer and fan of automation, applying this in both is work and personal time. In the professional world Allan has been working with various linux distributions since 2006, helping colleagues and teams to best utilise their full capabilities.

Outside of work Allan likes to play games, typically with some flavour of strategy. When he can spend time with friends, this also extends to table top games (the online ones don't quite feel the same to play!). Watching others play is a great way to learn strategy too, especially when you've found yourself at a wall.

Allan's primary focus in recent years has been on enablement of others, in immediate teams and wider, sharing beyond whenever possible. Helping yourself learn you can understand quite a lot, helping many people you can begin a movement.
